## Mathematical Formatting Guidelines

When writing mathematical expressions, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency:
- Do not add spaces with \, \; for extra space in latex-like expressions for math.
- For math expressions always do write ```$$``` with an empty line before and after, and make sure that the math inside ```$$...$$``` is contained in ```$$\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}$$```. In other words, they should always come in the form of
  ```

  $$
  \begin{equation}
  ...
  \end{equation}
  $$

  ```
- Mathematical expressions should part of complete sentences. Ensure that punctuation is used appropriately within and around mathematical expressions.
