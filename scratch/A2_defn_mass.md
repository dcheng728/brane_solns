# Definition of mass

The ADM mass, defined for asymptotically flat spacetimes (as in the case of many brane solutions), is

$$
M = \frac{1}{2\kappa_{10}^2}\int_{S_\infty^{d-2}} (\partial_j h_{ij} - \partial_i h_{jj})n^i dS
$$

If $g_{mn}^{(E)}$ is an asymptotically-flat solution in the Einstein frame, then in the string frame $e^{\Phi/2}g^{(E)}_{mn}$ is asymptotically-flat up to a constant factor:

$$
g^{(S)}_{mn} \big|_{r\to\infty} = g_s^{1/2} \eta_{mn}.
$$

To evaluate the ADM mass in the string frame, we perform a
