\section{IIA and 11d}

An interesting thing to note is that despite F1 and NS5 are often thought of as being electromagnetic duals of each other in the type IIA theory, they are actually not dual to each other in 10d, as one can quickly verify.

\paragraph{F1}
\begin{equation}
ds_{(S)}^2 = H^{-1}(-dt^2+dx_1^2) + dx^mdx^m,\quad
\frac{e^{\Phi}}{g_s} = H^{-1/2},\quad
B_{01} = H^{-1}-1
\end{equation}

\paragraph{NS5}
\begin{equation}
ds_{(S)}^2 = dx_\parallel^2 + H \cdot dx_\perp^2,\quad
\frac{e^{\Phi}}{g_s} = H^{1/2},\quad
H_3 = \star_4 dH
\end{equation}

In 10d the Einstein and string frame metrics are different while the scalar and form fields are the same, so one can also ask the question of what metric are we using to take the duality? 

However, in 11d, there is only one metric, so it makes sense to take electromagnetic duality, and indeed the form fields sourced by M2 and M5 are EM duals.

\paragraph{M2}
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = H^{-2/3}ds_{1,2}^2 + H^{1/3}ds_8^2,\quad
(\mathcal C_3)_{\mu_0 \mu_1 \mu_2} = \varepsilon_{\mu_0 \mu_1 \mu_2}(H^{-1}-1)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(*_{11}d\mathcal{C}_3)_{m_1m_2m_3m_4m_5m_6m_7} = \varepsilon_{m_1m_2m_3m_4m_5m_6m_7n}\partial_n H
\end{equation}

To obtain the form field for the M2 brane, one decompose $\varepsilon_8 = \varepsilon_3 \varepsilon_5$.

\paragraph{M5}
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = H^{-1/3}ds_{1,5}^2 + H^{2/3}ds_5^2,\quad
(\mathcal F_4)_{m_1 m_2 m_3 m_4} = \varepsilon_{m_1 m_2 m_3 m_4 n} \partial_n H
\end{equation}

\section{IIB and 12d}

We would like to ask the same question about type IIB.
Interestingly, despite one often associate F1 and NS5 as EM duals of each other, their form fields $H_3$ configuration are not related by EM duality, in 10d.
Furthermore, the F1 and NS5 have different dilaton profiles while EM duality does not act on the dilaton. 

However, an SL(2,Z) duality transformation would indeed map the dilaton of F1 to that of NS5, so one would like to ask: we know that the 10d type IIB EM duality is intimately tied to SL(2,Z) from the worldvolume action of the D3 brane, could there be a similar story with other branes?
